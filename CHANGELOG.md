- All paste commands push a mark to the opposite side of the pasted region.

### Fixed

- Run highlighting of secondary matches for "ISearch" and "Search/Replace" in separate thread.
- Fix Isearch bug where reverse search started at origin when a letter was added after previous searches.
- EmacsJ keymap: remove keybindings from keymap "$default" clashing with plugin prefix "Ctrl-U".
